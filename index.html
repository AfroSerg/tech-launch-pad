                        <h3 class="body-title">Purpose of the Tech Launch Pad:</h3>
                        <p class="body-text">Many students walk around with fantastic ideas that they can only dream about selling. A tangible
                            proof of concept, or prototype, is often required if the entrepreneur wishes to acquire the necessary
                            funding to fully develop the envisaged product. The person, or group of people, who came up with
                            such an idea may not have the funds and/or technical skills to develop a prototype.</p>

                        <p class="body-text">The main purpose of the Tech Launch Pad is to provide financial and technical support and guidance
                            to vetted and selected student entrepreneurs to develop a proof of concept and a proper business
                            plan for their idea. As a result, these students will have a tangible prototype that can be taken
                            used to source further funding and growth. In cases where the required resources and complexity
                            of discovered product ideas are simple enough, it may even be possible to assist the chosen students
                            through the seed stage as well, which will leave them with a product that can be taken to market.</p>


                        <h3>Who may participate ?</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Any registered UP student,</li>
                            <li>with an original, useful idea.</li>
                        </ul> *no development experience is required
                        <p>We encourage participants to form groups that include students from different disciplines as this
                            will enrich their final design idea.</p>

                        <h3>How will it work?</h3>
                        <p class="body-text">100 students will be selected and self-divided into +-25 groups. each will bring their idea to the
                            competition.
                        </p>
                        There are wo rounds.</p>
                        <h4>Round 1:</h4>
                        <span>Fri 23 Feb from 17:30 until 20:30</span>
                        <p class="body-text">groups will gather in the exhibition hall to create paper based prototypes to convey their idea.
                            No pre-created prototypes may be brought in. We will provide all the material they need for this
                            and the will get a short introduction into participatory design with low fidelity prototyping
                            (or prototyping with “bags of stuff”, as we call it). They will be given two hours to create
                            the prototype and will leave their prototypes at the venue for the night.</p>
                        <p class="body-text">By 9:00 on the 24th all groups must upload a powerpoint (or similar) presentation describing their
                            prototype. They will use this in a 10 minute presentation on the 24th in front of a panel of
                            expert judges who will pick the 10 best ideas. These 10 groups will be announced on the evening
                            of the 24th at a dinner in the exhibition space. The winners will receive prizes to the value
                            of R2000 per group and they will go to the second round.</p>
                        <h4>Round 2:</h4>
                        <p class="body-text">The 10 groups have three weeks to refine their prototype and presentation. As a first step, they
                            have to complete a free, short, online course on entrepreneurship. Where necessary they will
                            receive mentoring from TuksNovation during this period.</p>
                        <p class="body-text">On 16 March they will again present their ideas to a panel of judges. Now their presentation has
                            to include a more refined prototype and a business plan. In this round the final 3 winners will
                            be selected. They will receive prizes to the value of R10 000 per group, but their main prize
                            will be that Tech Launch Pad and TuksNovation will appoint development teams to implement their
                            ideas so that by Nov 2018 they have a fully implemented, working version of their idea and a
                            proper business plan that they can sell to whoever is interested. They will stay involved throughout
                            the design and development process.
