                        <p class="body-text">Tech Launch Pad is an initiative created for students entreprenuers walking around with fantastic
                            ideas that they can only dream about selling.
                        </p>

                        <p class="body-text">We aim to equip student entreprenuers with financial and technical support, as well as guidance towards
                            developing a proof of concept and a proper business plan for their ideas. </p>

                        <h3>What do the winners of the Tech Launch Pad competition get?</h3>
                        <p class="body-text">For starters, the teams with the most innovative, original and useful ideas will win awesome prizes
                            (cash or otherwise - it’s a surprise) directly after being announced as winners. But even better
                            than that is that the top 3 teams from the competition will have the amazing opportunity to work
                            with a handpicked team of engineers to bring their idea to life. </p>
                        <p class="body-text">After the development of their prototypes, winning teams will also receive mentorship from some of
                            the top entrepreneurial minds in SA facilitated by TuksNovation in partnership with UP’s Graduate
                            School of Technology Management, Gordon’s Institute of Business Science (GIBS), and the Small
                            Enterprise Development Agency (SEDA).</p>
                        <p class="body-text">The vision is that the winning teams will have a prototype and the necessary business skills to take
                            their product to market.</p>

                            original and useful idea and you are a registered UP student, then put together a team and sign

                            The competition will consist of two rounds.
                        </p>
                        <p class="body-text">In Round 1, teams will develop and refine their ideas through a participatory design session (don’t
                            worry if you don’t know what that is, we will show you). Thereafter, each group will present
                            their idea by way of showing their designs accompanied by a slideshow to a panel of carefully
                            selected and highly respected judges. The top 10 teams will move on to Round 2.</p>
                        <p class="body-text">In Round 2, the 10 best teams will receive valuable entrepreneurship training through the one day
                            TuksNovation Business Bootcamp. After the training, the teams will be expected to put together
                            a commercialisation strategy and business plan built upon the idea they presented in round 1.
                            These will again be evaluated by expert judges who will select the top 3 teams.</p>
