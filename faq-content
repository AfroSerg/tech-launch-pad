						What do the winners of the Tech Launch Pad competition get?
					</div>
					<div class="-text lh-copy ">
						For starters, the teams with the most innovative, original and useful ideas will win awesome prizes (cash or otherwise - it’s a surprise) directly after being announced as winners. But even better than that is that the top 3 teams from the competition will have the amazing opportunity to work with a handpicked team of engineers to bring their idea to life.
						<br><br>
						After the development of their prototypes, winning teams will also receive mentorship from some of the top entrepreneurial minds in SA facilitated by TuksNovation in partnership with UP’s Graduate School of Technology Management, Gordon’s Institute of Business Science (GIBS), and the Small Enterprise Development Agency (SEDA).
						<br><br>
						The vision is that the winning teams will have a prototype and the necessary business skills to take their product to market.
