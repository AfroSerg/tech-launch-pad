						In Round 1, teams will develop and refine their ideas through a participatory design session (don’t worry if you don’t know what that is, we will show you). Thereafter, each group will present their idea by way of showing their designs accompanied by a slideshow to a panel of carefully selected and highly respected judges. The top 10 teams will move on to Round 2.
						<br/><br/>
						In Round 2, the 10 best teams will receive valuable entrepreneurship training through the one day TuksNovation Business Bootcamp. After the training, the teams will be expected to put together a commercialisation strategy and business plan built upon the idea they presented in round 1. These will again be evaluated by expert judges who will select the top 3 teams.
