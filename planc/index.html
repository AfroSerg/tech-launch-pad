			<h3>
				What do the winners of the Tech Launch Pad competition get?
			</h3>
			<div>
				<p class="lh-copy -text">
					For starters, the teams with the most innovative, original and useful ideas will win awesome prizes (cash or otherwise -
					it’s a surprise) directly after being announced as winners. But even better than that is that the top 3 teams from the
					competition will have the amazing opportunity to work with a handpicked team of engineers to bring their idea to life.
					<br>
					<br> After the development of their prototypes, winning teams will also receive mentorship from some of the top entrepreneurial
					minds in SA facilitated by TuksNovation in partnership with UP’s Graduate School of Technology Management, Gordon’s
					Institute of Business Science (GIBS), and the Small Enterprise Development Agency (SEDA).
					<br>
					<br> The vision is that the winning teams will have a prototype and the necessary business skills to take their product
					to market.
				</p>
			</div>

			<h3>
				Who may participate?
			</h3>
			<div>
				<p class="lh-copy -text">
					Teams of 2 to 5 made up of any students registered at the University of Pretoria. If you have an original and useful idea
					and you are a registered UP student, then put together a team and sign up as quickly as possible.
				</p>

			<h3>
				Do participants need any programming experience?
			</h3>
			<div>
				<p class="lh-copy -text">
					No software development experience is required. We encourage participants to form teams that include students from different

			</h3>
			<div>
				<p class="lh-copy -text">
					Teams of 2 to 4 University of Pretoria students will sign up for the Tech Launch Pad competition. The competition will consist
					of two rounds.
					<br/>
					<br/> In Round 1, teams will develop and refine their ideas through a participatory design session (don’t worry if you don’t
					know what that is, we will show you). Thereafter, each group will present their idea by way of showing their designs
					accompanied by a slideshow to a panel of carefully selected and highly respected judges. The top 10 teams will move
					on to Round 2.
					<br/>
					<br/> In Round 2, the 10 best teams will receive valuable entrepreneurship training through an online Entreprneursip Bootcamp.
					After the training, the teams will be expected to put together a commercialisation strategy and business plan built
					upon the idea they presented in round 1. These will again be evaluated by expert judges who will select the top 3 teams
